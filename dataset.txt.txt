lawyer who specializes in employment law to understand your rights and explore legal
remedies.
Situation 3: "I've been subjected to harassment and discrimination at my workplace.
What steps should I take?"
Answer: Harassment and discrimination at the workplace are serious violations of
employment rights. Document instances of harassment, gather any evidence such as
emails, witnesses, or records, and report the incidents to your HR department or
management. If the issue is not resolved internally, consult an employment lawyer who
can guide you on filing a formal complaint with relevant authorities and pursuing legal
action if necessary.
Situation 4: "My employer is asking me to work long hours and on weekends without
overtime pay. What are my rights?"
Answer: In India, the law specifies maximum working hours and mandates overtime pay
for working beyond those hours. If your employer is making you work excessively long
hours without proper compensation, it might be a violation of labor laws. Consult a
lawyer to understand your rights and options, including approaching labor authorities or
filing a complaint.
Situation 5: "I want to resign from my job, but my employer is not accepting my
resignation and is forcing me to continue working. What should I do?"

employer cannot force you to continue working against your will. Communicate your
resignation in writing and maintain a copy for your records. If your employer still refuses
to accept your resignation, consult a lawyer who can guide you on the proper legal
steps to take.
Situation 6: "My employer has changed my job profile without my consent, and I'm not
comfortable with the new role. Can they do this?"
Answer: An employer generally cannot unilaterally change an employee's job profile
without consent, unless such flexibility is outlined in the employment contract. If the
change affects your job, responsibilities, or compensation adversely, consult a lawyer
who can review your employment terms and advise you on how to address the
situation.
Situation 7: "I've been asked to sign a non-compete agreement. Is this enforceable?"
Answer: Non-compete agreements can be enforceable if they are reasonable in terms
of duration, geographical scope, and the nature of the restriction. Consult a lawyer to
review the terms of the non-compete agreement and provide guidance on whether it's
enforceable and how it might affect your future employment options.
Situation 8: "I've been injured on the job due to unsafe working conditions. Can I seek
compensation?"
Answer: If you've been injured due to unsafe working conditions, you might be entitled
to compensation under workers' compensation laws. Document the incident, seek
medical attention, and report the injury to your employer as soon as possible. Consult
an employment lawyer who can guide you on filing a workers' compensation claim and
seeking the appropriate compensation.
Situation 9: "My employer has not provided me with a written employment contract. Is
this a problem?"
Answer: While a written employment contract is not always required, it's recommended
to have clear terms in writing to avoid disputes. Even without a written contract, verbal
agreements and past practices can be considered as terms of employment. Consult a
lawyer who can help you understand your rights and obligations even in the absence of
a formal written contract.
Situation 10: "I want to file a sexual harassment complaint against a coworker. What's
the process?"
Answer: Sexual harassment complaints should be taken seriously. As per the law, your
employer is required to have a sexual harassment prevention policy and committee.
Follow the internal complaint process outlined by your employer. If you're not satisfied
with the internal resolution, consult a lawyer who can guide you on filing a formal
complaint with the appropriate authorities.
Situation 11: "My employer has not provided any maternity leave or benefits. What can I
do?"
Answer: Maternity benefits are a legal entitlement in India. If your employer is not
providing maternity leave or benefits, it's a violation of the law. Consult a lawyer who
specializes in employment law to understand your rights, file a complaint with labor
authorities if necessary, and seek appropriate compensation and benefits.
Situation 12: "I've been asked to sign a waiver releasing the company from any future
claims. Is this valid?"
Answer: The validity of a waiver depends on various factors, including the
circumstances and the nature of the claim being waived. Consult a lawyer to review the
waiver and provide advice on its enforceability. Waivers that violate employment laws or
public policy might not be upheld in court.
Situation 13: "I've been offered a new job, and my new employer is asking me to
provide confidential information about my current employer. Should I comply?"
Answer: Sharing confidential information about your current employer without proper
authorization could have legal implications. Consult a lawyer who can guide you on
ethical considerations, potential legal risks, and how to handle such requests without
violating your current employer's rights.
Situation 14: "My employer is not providing any employee benefits, such as provident
fund or health insurance. Is this mandatory?"

lawyer who can advise you on the mandatory benefits applicable to your employment
and guide you on addressing the issue with your employer.
Situation 15: "My employer has terminated me due to 'restructuring,' but I suspect it's
due to discrimination. How can I prove this?"

discrimination you've experienced, gather evidence such as emails, witnesses, or
records, and consult a lawyer with expertise in employment law. They can guide you on
how to establish a potential case of discrimination and advise you on the appropriate
legal steps to take.

from joining a competitor for a certain period after leaving. Can I negotiate this clause
?"

fair. Consult a lawyer who can review the terms of the contract, assess the
enforceability of the non-compete clause, and advise you on how to negotiate with your
employer to ensure that your future employment options are not unduly restricted.
Situation 17: "My employer is not providing proper facilities for female employees, such
as restrooms and breaks. What should I do?"

employees as mandated by labor laws in India. Document instances of non-compliance
and report the issue to your HR department or management. If the issue is not resolved,
consult a lawyer who can guide you on filing a complaint with relevant authorities.
Situation 18: "I've been asked to work during public holidays without any extra pay. Is
this legal?"
Answer: Generally, employees are entitled to extra pay for working on public holidays.
Consult a lawyer who can advise you on your rights and how to address the situation. If
your employer is not complying with labor laws, you might be entitled to compensation
for the extra work.
Situation 19: "The other party is claiming that I breached the contract, but I believe I
fulfilled my responsibilities. What should I do?"
Answer: If you believe you've fulfilled your contractual obligations, review the contract to
understand the specific terms you're being accused of breaching. Gather evidence that
supports your claim of compliance, such as correspondence, receipts, and performance
records. You can respond to the other party with your evidence and attempt negotiation
to resolve the dispute. If negotiation fails, consult a lawyer to assess the strength of your
case and consider legal action if necessary.
Situation 20: "I want to terminate a contract due to the other party's repeated delays.
Can I do this?"
Answer: Terminating a contract due to delays depends on the contract terms and the
nature of the delays. Review the contract for any provisions related to delays and
termination. If the delays constitute a material breach, you might have grounds for
termination. However, it's important to follow the termination procedure outlined in the
contract or under the law. Consult a lawyer to ensure proper steps are taken.
Situation 21: "The other party is demanding changes to the contract after we've already
agreed upon the terms. What should I do?"
Answer: If the other party is requesting contract changes after agreement, carefully
evaluate their proposals. Determine if the changes are reasonable and align with your
interests. If you're not comfortable with the changes, you can negotiate to maintain the
original terms. Any changes should be properly documented and agreed upon by both
parties.
Situation 22: "I signed a contract, but circumstances have changed, and I'm unable to
fulfill my obligations. What should I do?"
Answer: If you're unable to fulfill your contractual obligations due to changed
circumstances, review the contract for any force majeure or frustration clauses that
address unforeseen events. These clauses might provide relief in situations beyond
your control. Communicate your situation to the other party and attempt to renegotiate
the terms. If renegotiation is not possible, consult a lawyer to explore legal options.
Situation 23: "The contract I signed is vague, and both parties have different
interpretations of its terms. What can I do?"
Answer: Vague contract terms can lead to disputes. In such cases, it's important to
objectively interpret the contract by considering the intentions of both parties, industry
norms, and past practices. If negotiation fails to resolve the differences, you might need
legal assistance to seek a court's interpretation of the ambiguous terms.
Situation 24: "The other party is refusing to pay the agreed-upon amount after I
delivered the goods as per the contract. What actions can I take?"
Answer: If the other party is not paying as agreed, review the contract to ensure you've
fulfilled your obligations. Document evidence of the goods delivered, invoices, and any
communications related to payment. Send a formal notice demanding payment. If
negotiation fails, you can consider legal action for recovery of payment.
Situation 25: "I want to cancel a contract I signed, but there's no provision for
cancellation. What can I do?"
Answer: If the contract doesn't have a cancellation provision, canceling might be
challenging. Review the contract for any termination clauses that might apply. If you
have valid reasons for canceling, such as a breach by the other party, consult a lawyer
to explore your options. Termination without legal justification could lead to breach of
contract claims.
Situation 26: "I suspect the other party misrepresented facts to induce me into signing
the contract. What steps should I take?"
Answer: If you believe you were induced into signing the contract based on false
information, gather evidence of the misrepresentation, such as emails, advertisements,
or statements. Consult a lawyer to evaluate whether the misrepresentation is material
and if it constitutes fraud or deceit. You might have grounds to void the contract based
on fraudulent inducement.
Situation 27: "The contract I signed includes an arbitration clause. Can I still take the
dispute to court?"
Answer: If the contract includes an arbitration clause, parties are typically bound to
resolve disputes through arbitration as specified in the clause. However, certain
circumstances might allow you to challenge the arbitration clause's validity. Consult a
lawyer to assess your options and determine if court litigation is possible.
Situation 28: "I've been asked to provide a written response to the other party's breach
of contract allegations. What should I include in my response?"
Answer: In your written response, address each of the allegations with a clear and
concise explanation of your position. Provide evidence that supports your claims and
cites relevant contract clauses. Be professional and avoid emotional language. Your
response should aim to demonstrate your commitment to resolving the matter amicably.
Situation 29: "The contract dispute involves a third party who wasn't initially part of the
agreement. What should I consider?"
Answer: If a third party is involved in a contract dispute, determine their role and
connection to the contract. Review the contract to see if it addresses third-party rights or
obligations. Depending on the circumstances, the third party might need to be brought
into the dispute resolution process or a separate action might be required.
Situation 30: "The other party is threatening legal action. What steps can I take to
prepare for a potential lawsuit?"
Answer: If you anticipate a lawsuit, gather and organize all relevant documents,
communication records, and evidence related to the contract and the dispute. Consult a
lawyer to assess the strengths and weaknesses of your case and develop a strategy to
respond to the potential legal action.
Situation 31: "I want to avoid going to court for the contract dispute. Are there
alternatives?"
Answer: Yes, there are alternatives to court litigation. Mediation and arbitration are
commonly used alternative dispute resolution methods. Mediation involves a neutral
mediator helping parties negotiate a resolution. Arbitration involves a neutral arbitrator
making a binding decision. Both methods can save time and costs compared to
traditional litigation.
Situation 32: "The contract specifies a penalty for breach. Is this enforceable?"
Answer: Contractual penalties are generally unenforceable in India. However, liquidated
damages, which are genuine pre-estimates of potential losses due to breach, might be
enforceable. Consult a lawyer to evaluate whether the penalty clause in your contract
can be enforced.
Situation 33: "The other party is threatening to terminate the contract due to alleged
breaches on
my part. What are my rights in this situation?"
Answer: Review the contract terms to understand the specific breaches alleged by the
other party. If you believe the allegations are not valid or are minor, you can dispute
them. If the breaches are substantial and material, consider whether you have grounds
to cure them within the contract's provisions. Consult a lawyer to determine the best
course of action.
Situation 34: "I want to protect my interests in case of a contract dispute. Can I include
clauses to address potential disputes in the future?"
Answer: Yes, you can include clauses in the contract to address potential disputes. For
example, a dispute resolution clause can specify the method (mediation, arbitration) for
resolving disputes. A force majeure clause can address unforeseen events. Consult a
lawyer to draft these clauses to ensure they are enforceable and tailored to your needs.
Situation 35: "The contract dispute involves significant financial implications. How can I
estimate potential damages?"
Answer: To estimate potential damages, review the contract terms and assess how the
breach has affected you financially. Consider direct damages (losses that directly result
from the breach) and indirect damages (consequential losses). Consult a lawyer to help
calculate the appropriate damages and build a strong case.
Situation 36: "I suspect that the other party has provided subpar goods compared to
what was agreed upon in the contract. How can I address this?"
Answer: In case of subpar goods, review the contract terms related to quality and
specifications. Gather evidence such as photographs, inspection reports, and
communication regarding the quality issue. Communicate your concerns to the other
party in writing, providing evidence of the discrepancy. Attempt negotiation for
replacement, repair, or compensation. If negotiation fails, consult a lawyer to explore
legal options.
Situation 37: "I want to terminate the contract due to the other party's non-performance.
What are the legal implications of termination?"
Answer: Terminating a contract due to non-performance requires careful consideration.
Review the contract terms regarding termination, notice period, and remedies. Ensure
that the other party's non-performance constitutes a material breach that justifies
termination. Follow the contract's termination procedure and consult a lawyer to
minimize legal risks.
Situation 38: "I have discovered that the contract I signed has unfair terms that heavily
favor the other party. Can these terms be challenged?"
Answer: Unfair terms in a contract can potentially be challenged under Indian law,
especially if they are unconscionable or contrary to public policy. Consult a lawyer to
assess the validity of the unfair terms and explore options for renegotiation or
challenging those terms in court.
Situation 39: "I've been informed that the other party has assigned their rights and
obligations under the contract to a third party. What should I do?"
Answer: If the other party has assigned the contract to a third party, review the contract
to determine if assignment is allowed and under what conditions. The assignee should
provide notice of the assignment. Assess the financial capability and reputation of the
assignee. If uncomfortable with the assignment, consult a lawyer to understand your
rights and any potential implications.
Situation 40: "I want to modify certain terms of the contract as the circumstances have
changed. Can I do this without the other party's consent?"
Answer: Modifying contract terms without the other party's consent can be risky and
might lead to disputes. Generally, both parties need to agree on contract amendments.
Consult a lawyer to assess the necessity of the changes, the potential legal
consequences, and the best approach to obtain the other party's consent.

management for workplace injuries). Your well-being and proper documentation are crucial for building
a case.
Question 2: Should I file a police report for my personal injury?
Answer: If your injury resulted from criminal activity, such as an assault or hit-and-run accident, you
should file a police report. The First Information Report (FIR) provides an official record of the incident.

and the responsible party's negligence.
Question 3: How do I preserve evidence of my injuries and the incident?
Answer: Document the scene with photographs and videos showing the conditions that led to your
injury. Keep copies of any medical reports, prescriptions, and treatment records related to your injuries.
Collect contact information from any witnesses who can testify to the circumstances of the incident.
Preserving evidence strengthens your case and supports your claims.
Question 4: "Should I communicate with the other party or their insurance company?"\
Answer: It's generally best to avoid direct communication with the other party or their insurance
company without consulting a lawyer. Anything you say could be used against you. If you're contacted,
let them know you're seeking legal advice and refer them to your lawyer. Your lawyer can guide you on
how to handle interactions to protect your interests.

concept are important in personal injury cases.
Question 7: What compensation am I entitled to for my personal injury?
Answer: Compensation in personal injury cases can include medical expenses, lost wages, pain and
suffering, and in some cases, punitive damages. The extent of compensation depends on the severity of
your injuries, the impact on your life, and other relevant factors. Consult a lawyer who can evaluate your
case and help determine the appropriate compensation.
Question 8: "Should I consider settling out of court or pursuing litigation?
Answer: Whether to settle or litigate depends on the specifics of your case. Settlement can be quicker
and less stressful, but litigation might be necessary if the other party denies liability or offers inadequate
compensation. Consult your lawyer to understand the pros and cons of both options based on your
circumstances.
Question 9: "What's the time limit to file a personal injury claim?
Answer: The time limit to file a personal injury claim is governed by the Limitation Act, 1963. The statute

in your claim being barred. Consulting a lawyer early helps ensure you meet the necessary deadlines.
Question 10: Can I seek legal aid for my personal injury case?
Answer: Yes, you can seek legal aid if you meet the criteria for free legal assistance based on your
financial situation. Legal Aid Services in India provide legal representation to economically
disadvantaged individuals. Consult a legal aid agency or a personal injury lawyer to explore this option.
Question 11: Can I still pursue a personal injury claim if I contributed to the accident?
Answer: Yes, you can still pursue a personal injury claim even if you contributed to the accident. India
follows the principle of contributory negligence. The compensation you receive might be reduced based
on your percentage of fault. Consult a lawyer to understand how contributory negligence may affect
your case.
Question 12: "What role does the insurance company play in my personal injury case?"\
Answer: If there is insurance coverage involved (e.g., motor vehicle insurance, liability insurance), the
insurance company of the responsible party might be involved in settling the claim. However, insurance
companies aim to minimize payouts. It's important to consult a personal injury lawyer to ensure you
receive fair compensation and that your rights are protected during negotiations with insurers.
Question 13: Can I file a personal injury claim on behalf of a minor or incapacitated person?
Answer: Yes, you can file a personal injury claim on behalf of a minor or an incapacitated person.
However, the legal process might differ. Consult a lawyer to understand the requirements and
procedures for filing a claim on behalf of someone unable to do so themselves.
Question 14: "What is the role of medical evidence in my personal injury case?
Answer: Medical evidence is crucial in establishing the extent and nature of your injuries. It helps link
the injuries to the incident and determines the compensation you're entitled to. Ensure you receive
thorough medical treatment, follow your doctor's recommendations, and retain all medical records.
Your lawyer will use these records to build a strong case for compensation.
Question 15: What happens if the responsible party doesn't have the means to compensate me?
Answer: If the responsible party doesn't have sufficient assets or insurance to cover your compensation,
recovering your full compensation might be challenging. However, your lawyer can help explore various
avenues, such as garnishing wages, attaching property, or negotiating structured settlements, to secure
the compensation you deserve.
Question 16: What is the process of filing a personal injury lawsuit?
Answer: Filing a personal injury lawsuit involves several steps, including gathering evidence, drafting a
legal complaint, serving the defendant, pre-trial discovery, negotiations, and potentially going to trial.
The process can vary based on the specifics of your case and the court's procedures. A personal injury
lawyer can guide you through each step.
Question 17: "Can I switch lawyers if I'm not satisfied with my current representation?

representation. However, it's important to handle the transition professionally to minimize disruptions
in your case. Notify your current lawyer in writing and obtain all your case-related documents before
formally engaging a new lawyer.
Question 18:"What documents should I bring to my initial consultation with a personal injury lawyer?
Answer:To make the most of your initial consultation, bring any relevant documents such as incident
reports, medical records, photographs of the scene or injuries, correspondence with the other party or
their insurer, and any other evidence you have. This will help the lawyer assess your case and provide
informed advice.
Question 19:"Can I handle my personal injury case on my own without hiring a lawyer?"
Answer:While it's possible to handle your own case, personal injury cases involve legal complexities and
nuances that can significantly impact your outcome. A lawyer can provide legal expertise, negotiate on
your behalf, and ensure your rights are protected. Hiring a lawyer increases your chances of receiving
fair compensation.
Question 20: "What costs are associated with pursuing a personal injury case?
Answer:Pursuing a personal injury case involves costs such as lawyer fees, court filing fees, expert
witness fees, and costs related to gathering evidence. Some lawyers work on a contingency fee basis,
where they only get paid if you win your case. Consult your lawyer to understand the specific costs
associated with your case.

insurance company to seek a fair settlement. This can involve exchanging information, presenting
evidence, and discussing compensation.

enforce the court's decision and ensure you receive the compensation awarded.
Contract dispute
Question 1: "I'm involved in a contract dispute. What should be my first step?"

outlined in the contract. Identify the areas of dispute and gather all related documents, including
correspondence and communications with the other party.

Answer: Litigation should be considered when negotiation and ADR options are exhausted, and the
dispute remains unresolved. Consult with a contract dispute lawyer to evaluate the strength of your
case and the likelihood of success in court.

disputes, such as arbitration or mediation. Follow the procedure specified in the contract's dispute
resolution clause.

Answer: Common defenses include lack of valid contract formation, mistake, duress, unconscionability,
and frustration of purpose. Consult your lawyer to determine the best defense strategy.
Question 10: "What remedies can I seek for a contract breach?"
Answer: Remedies for contract breaches include specific performance (enforcing the contract as
agreed), monetary damages, rescission (canceling the contract), and restitution. The appropriate
remedy depends on the circumstances of the case.
Question 11: "Can I continue performing my obligations under the contract during a dispute?"
Answer: Generally, you should continue performing your contractual obligations unless advised
otherwise by your lawyer. Failing to do so might weaken your position in the dispute.
Question 12: "What is the Limitation Act's relevance in contract disputes?"
Answer: The Limitation Act, 1963, sets a time limit within which a lawsuit must be filed. Contract
disputes should be filed within the specified time to avoid the claim being barred by the statute of
limitations.
Question 13: "What if the contract is silent on dispute resolution?"
Answer: If the contract doesn't specify a dispute resolution mechanism, you can resort to negotiation,
mediation, or litigation as appropriate.

important to follow proper procedures outlined in the contract or under the law. Consult your lawyer to
ensure you terminate the contract in a legally valid manner.
Question 17: "What is the role of a notice of demand in a contract dispute?"
Answer: A notice of demand is a formal communication to the other party, stating the breach of
contract and the remedies you seek. It serves as a precursor to legal action and may lead to
negotiations or settlement discussions.
Question 18: "What is the significance of good faith in contract disputes?
Answer: The principle of good faith requires parties to act honestly and fairly in their contractual
dealings. Courts consider good faith when interpreting contract terms and resolving disputes.

might cause irreparable harm during the course of the dispute. Your lawyer can advise you on the
feasibility of obtaining an injunction.
Question 21: "What is the difference between a breach of condition and a breach of warranty?"
Answer: In contract law, a breach of condition is a serious violation that goes to the core of the contract,

complex matters relevant to the dispute. Their testimony can help the court understand intricate
aspects of the case.
Question 24: "Can a contract dispute be resolved through arbitration?"
Answer: Yes, parties can agree to resolve their contract dispute through arbitration, where an arbitrator
or a panel of arbitrators renders a decision. Arbitration can be less formal, faster, and more private than
litigation.
Question 25: "What is the doctrine of frustration in contract law?"
Answer: The doctrine of frustration applies when unforeseen events occur that make it impossible to
perform the contract. In such cases, the contract might be considered frustrated, releasing both parties
from their obligations. However, this doctrine has specific conditions that need to be met.
Question 26: "How does the court determine the damages in a contract dispute case?"
Answer: The court determines damages based on the loss suffered by the innocent party due to the
breach. Damages aim to put the innocent party in the position they would have been in if the contract
had been fulfilled.
Question 27: "What is the role of the Indian Contract Act in contract disputes?"
Answer: The Indian Contract Act, 1872, governs contract law in India. It defines the essentials of a valid
contract, rights and obligations of parties, and remedies for breach. It provides
a legal framework for resolving contract disputes.

party. In a bilateral contract, both parties exchange promises. Understanding the type of contract you
have is important in a contract dispute.
Question 30: "What happens if the terms of the contract are unclear?"
Answer: If the terms of the contract are unclear or ambiguous, the court will interpret them objectively,
considering the intentions of the parties, industry practices, and the surrounding circumstances.
Situations
Situation 1: "I signed a contract for a service, but the other party is not delivering as promised. What can
I do?"
Answer: In this situation, you should first review the contract terms to understand the agreed-upon
services and timelines. If the other party is not fulfilling their obligations, you might send them a formal
notice of demand stating the breach and the desired remedies. If negotiation fails, you can consider
legal action for breach of contract to seek appropriate compensation or performance.
Situation 2: "The other party is claiming that I breached the contract, but I believe I fulfilled my
responsibilities. What should I do?"
Answer: If you believe you've fulfilled your contractual obligations, review the contract to understand
the specific terms you're being accused of breaching. Gather evidence that supports your claim of
compliance, such as correspondence, receipts, and performance records. You can respond to the other
party with your evidence and attempt negotiation to resolve the dispute. If negotiation fails, consult a
lawyer to assess the strength of your case and consider legal action if necessary.
Situation 3: "I want to terminate a contract due to the other party's repeated delays. Can I do this?"
Answer: Terminating a contract due to delays depends on the contract terms and the nature of the
delays. Review the contract for any provisions related to delays and termination. If the delays
constitute a material breach, you might have grounds for termination. However, it's important to follow
the termination procedure outlined in the contract or under the law. Consult a lawyer to ensure proper
steps are taken.
Situation 4: "The other party is demanding changes to the contract after we've already agreed upon the
terms. What should I do?"
Answer: If the other party is requesting contract changes after agreement, carefully evaluate their
proposals. Determine if the changes are reasonable and align with your interests. If you're not
comfortable with the changes, you can negotiate to maintain the original terms. Any changes should be
properly documented and agreed upon by both parties.
Situation 5: "I signed a contract, but circumstances have changed, and I'm unable to fulfill my
obligations. What should I do?"
Answer: If you're unable to fulfill your contractual obligations due to changed circumstances, review the
contract for any force majeure or frustration clauses that address unforeseen events. These clauses
might provide relief in situations beyond your control. Communicate your situation to the other party
and attempt to renegotiate the terms. If renegotiation is not possible, consult a lawyer to explore legal
options.
Situation 6: "The contract I signed is vague, and both parties have different interpretations of its terms.
What can I do?"
Answer: Vague contract terms can lead to disputes. In such cases, it's important to objectively interpret
the contract by considering the intentions of both parties, industry norms, and past practices. If
negotiation fails to resolve the differences, you might need legal assistance to seek a court's
interpretation of the ambiguous terms.
Situation 7: "The other party is refusing to pay the agreed-upon amount after I delivered the goods as
per the contract. What actions can I take?"
Answer: If the other party is not paying as agreed, review the contract to ensure you've fulfilled your
obligations. Document evidence of the goods delivered, invoices, and any communications related to
payment. Send a formal notice demanding payment. If negotiation fails, you can consider legal action
for recovery of payment.
Situation 8: "I want to cancel a contract I signed, but there's no provision for cancellation. What can I
do?"
Answer: If the contract doesn't have a cancellation provision, canceling might be challenging. Review
the contract for any termination clauses that might apply. If you have valid reasons for canceling, such
as a breach by the other party, consult a lawyer to explore your options. Termination without legal
justification could lead to breach of contract claims.
Situation 9: "I suspect the other party misrepresented facts to induce me into signing the contract.
What steps should I take?"
Answer: If you believe you were induced into signing the contract based on false information, gather
evidence of the misrepresentation, such as emails, advertisements, or statements. Consult a lawyer to
evaluate whether the misrepresentation is material and if it constitutes fraud or deceit. You might have
grounds to void the contract based on fraudulent inducement.
Situation 10: "The contract I signed contains complex legal language that I don't understand. What
should I do?"
Answer: If you're unsure about the terms and language in the contract, seek legal advice before signing.
A lawyer can explain the provisions, their implications, and any potential risks. Understanding the
contract before signing can help you make informed decisions and avoid future disputes.
Situation 11: "I received a notice of breach of contract from the other party. What should be my
immediate steps?"
Answer: Upon receiving a notice of breach, carefully review the allegations and compare them with the
contract terms. Determine if the allegations are valid and whether you've indeed breached any terms. If
you believe the allegations are unfounded, gather evidence to support your position and respond in
writing to dispute the claims.
Situation 12: "The contract I signed includes an arbitration clause. Can I still take the dispute to court?"
Answer: If the contract includes an arbitration clause, parties are typically bound to resolve disputes
through arbitration as specified in the clause. However, certain circumstances might allow you to
challenge the arbitration clause's validity. Consult a lawyer to assess your options and determine if
court litigation is possible.
Situation 13: "I've been asked to provide a written response to the other party's breach of contract
allegations. What should I include in my response?"
Answer: In your written response, address each of the allegations with a clear and concise explanation
of your position. Provide evidence that supports your claims and cites relevant contract clauses. Be
professional and avoid emotional language. Your response should aim to demonstrate your
commitment to resolving the matter amicably.
Situation 14: "The contract dispute involves a third party who wasn't initially part of the agreement.
What should I consider?" Y
Answer: If a third party is involved in a contract dispute, determine their role and connection to the
contract. Review the contract to see if it addresses third-party rights or obligations. Depending on the
circumstances, the third party might need to be brought into the dispute resolution process or a
separate action might be required.
Situation 15: "The other party is threatening legal action. What steps can I take to prepare for a
potential lawsuit?"
Answer: If you anticipate a lawsuit, gather and organize all relevant documents, communication
records, and evidence related to the contract and the dispute. Consult a lawyer to assess the strengths
and weaknesses of your case and develop a strategy to respond to the potential legal action.
Situation 16: "I want to avoid going to court for the contract dispute. Are there alternatives?"
Answer: Yes, there are alternatives to court litigation. Mediation and arbitration are commonly used
alternative dispute resolution methods. Mediation involves a neutral mediator helping parties
negotiate a resolution. Arbitration involves a neutral arbitrator making a binding decision. Both
methods can save time and costs compared to traditional litigation.
Situation 17: "The contract specifies a penalty for breach. Is this enforceable?"
Answer: Contractual penalties are generally unenforceable in India. However, liquidated damages,
which are genuine pre-estimates of potential losses due to breach, might be enforce
able. Consult a lawyer to evaluate whether the penalty clause in your contract can be enforced.
Situation 18: "The other party is threatening to terminate the contract due to alleged breaches on my
part. What are my rights in this situation?"
Answer: Review the contract terms to understand the specific breaches alleged by the other party. If
you believe the allegations are not valid or are minor, you can dispute them. If the breaches are
substantial and material, consider whether you have grounds to cure them within the contract's
provisions. Consult a lawyer to determine the best course of action.
Situation 19: "I want to protect my interests in case of a contract dispute. Can I include clauses to
address potential disputes in the future?"
Answer: Yes, you can include clauses in the contract to address potential disputes. For example, a
dispute resolution clause can specify the method (mediation, arbitration) for resolving disputes. A force
majeure clause can address unforeseen events. Consult a lawyer to draft these clauses to ensure they
are enforceable and tailored to your needs.
Situation 20: "The contract dispute involves significant financial implications. How can I estimate
potential damages?"
Answer: To estimate potential damages, review the contract terms and assess how the breach has
affected you financially. Consider direct damages (losses that directly result from the breach) and
indirect damages (consequential losses). Consult a lawyer to help calculate the appropriate damages
and build a strong case.
Situation 21: "I suspect that the other party has provided subpar goods compared to what was agreed
upon in the contract. How can I address this?"
Answer: In case of subpar goods, review the contract terms related to quality and specifications. Gather
evidence such as photographs, inspection reports, and communication regarding the quality issue.
Communicate your concerns to the other party in writing, providing evidence of the discrepancy.
Attempt negotiation for replacement, repair, or compensation. If negotiation fails, consult a lawyer to
explore legal options.
Situation 22: "I want to terminate the contract due to the other party's non-performance. What are the
legal implications of termination?"
Answer: Terminating a contract due to non-performance requires careful consideration. Review the
contract terms regarding termination, notice period, and remedies. Ensure that the other party's non-
performance constitutes a material breach that justifies termination. Follow the contract's termination
procedure and consult a lawyer to minimize legal risks.
Situation 23: "I have discovered that the contract I signed has unfair terms that heavily favor the other
party. Can these terms be challenged?"
Answer: Unfair terms in a contract can potentially be challenged under Indian law, especially if they are
unconscionable or contrary to public policy. Consult a lawyer to assess the validity of the unfair terms
and explore options for renegotiation or challenging those terms in court.
Situation 24: "I've been informed that the other party has assigned their rights and obligations under
the contract to a third party. What should I do?"
Answer: If the other party has assigned the contract to a third party, review the contract to determine if
assignment is allowed and under what conditions. The assignee should provide notice of the
assignment. Assess the financial capability and reputation of the assignee. If uncomfortable with the
assignment, consult a lawyer to understand your rights and any potential implications.
Situation 25: "I want to modify certain terms of the contract as the circumstances have changed. Can I
do this without the other party's consent?"
Answer: Modifying contract terms without the other party's consent can be risky and might lead to
disputes. Generally, both parties need to agree on contract amendments. Consult a lawyer to assess the
necessity of the changes, the potential legal consequences, and the best approach to obtain the other
party's consent.
Situation 26: "I've received a notice of contract termination from the other party, but I believe they
don't have valid grounds for termination. What should I do?"
Answer: Review the contract terms that the other party is citing as grounds for termination. If you
believe their grounds are not valid, consult a lawyer to assess the validity of the termination notice. If
the notice is unjustified, you might challenge it and seek to continue the contract or claim damages for
wrongful termination.
Situation 27: "I want to pursue legal action against the other party for breach of contract. How do I
calculate the damages I'm entitled to?"
Answer: Calculating damages involves assessing the financial losses you've suffered due to the breach.
Review the contract to determine the agreed-upon damages formula or method. Consider direct and
consequential damages. Gather evidence of your losses, such as financial records and expert opinions if
necessary. Consult a lawyer to accurately calculate the damages you can claim.
Situation 28: "The contract I signed has an exclusion clause that limits the other party's liability. Can I
challenge this clause?"
Answer: Exclusion clauses can limit liability but might be subject to challenge if they are unreasonable
or ambiguous. Consult a lawyer to evaluate the validity of the exclusion clause based on Indian contract
law and precedents. The court might interpret and enforce such clauses cautiously, particularly if they
attempt to exclude liability for gross negligence or fraud.
Situation 29: "I've been notified that the other party intends to invoke a force majeure clause due to
unforeseen events. What does this mean for our contract?"
Answer: A force majeure clause excuses parties from performance due to unforeseen events beyond
their control. Review the contract to understand the force majeure clause's scope and the events it
covers. If applicable events have occurred, consult a lawyer to assess whether the clause can be
invoked, the rights and obligations of both parties, and potential remedies.
Situation 30: "I suspect that the other party is intentionally delaying the project to extend their
obligations under the contract. What can I do?"
Answer: Deliberate delay by the other party might be a breach of contract. Document all instances of
delay, including communication and evidence of their intentions. Review the contract's provisions
related to timelines and performance. If you believe there's a breach, consult a lawyer to evaluate your
case and explore options for enforcing the contract's terms or seeking damages.

GROUP INSOLVENCY UNDER IBC*
Introduction
The Insolvency and Bankruptcy Code, 2016 (the Code) was enacted with a view to consolidate
and amend the laws relating to reorganisation and insolvency resolution of corporate persons,
partnership firms and individuals in a time-bound manner for maximisation of value of assets
of such persons, to promote entrepreneurship, availability of credit and balance the interests of
all the stakeholders including alteration in the order or priority of payment of Government dues
and to establish an Insolvency and Bankruptcy Board of India.
According to Chapter 4 of Economic Survey 2019-20, Vol II titled " Monetary Management and
Financial Intermediation":- Three years into operation, the regime under the Insolvency and
Bankruptcy Code (IBC) boasts of a strong ecosystem, comprising the Adjudicating Authority, the
IBBI, three insolvency professional agencies, 11 registered valuer organisations and 2,374
registered valuers and 2,911 insolvency professionals (as on December 31, 2019). The debtors
and creditors alike are initiating the processes under the Code with 2,542 corporates, some of
them having very large nonperforming assets account, and undergoing corporate insolvency
resolution process. Upto September 2019, about 743 of them have completed the process
yielding either resolution or liquidation and 498 corporates have commenced voluntary
liquidation process. Out of the 562 Corporate Insolvency Resolution Process (CIRPs) initiated in
October-December 2019, 132 are under liquidation, and 14 have been already settled. As on end
December 2019, Rs. 1.58 lakh crore were realizable in cases resolved. These cases have been
filed under various sectors. 41.2 per cent of the cases admitted by NCLT for CIRP are in
manufacturing sector followed by 19 per cent in Real Estate, Renting and Business Activities
sector.
The Government has been proactively addressing the issues that come up in implementation of
the reform. Since its enactment in 2016, the Code has been amended three times, within a short
span of time, mainly to streamline the processes and address any lacuna to ensure proper
operationalizing of the provisions of the Code.
The first amendment has introduced section 29A of IBC, which deals with the provision to bar
promoters from bidding for their own companies. It prevented defaulters from regaining control
of their companies at a cheaper value. The second amendment has introduced section 12A of
IBC, which aims to provide creditors an option to withdraw insolvency application within 30
days of filing the petition. The amendment also stated that home buyers shall be treated as
financial creditors. This enables the home buyers a voice in the insolvency proceedings as they,
also provide funding for projects by making advance payments, and to discourage real estate
developers from defaulting on commitments not only to banks but also to their customers.

The third amendment primarily focused upon the revival of a Corporate Deator (CD) by ensuring
timely admission and completion of the resolution process. The amendment ensures that 14
days period deadline given to the NCLT for admitting or rejecting a resolution application shall
be strictly adhered to. The amendment of IBC further specifying the mandatory time frame of
330 days to complete the Corporate Insolvency Resolution Process (CIRP) without exception.
This tries to instill discipline amongst the stakeholders to avoid inordinate delays in the
insolvency resolution process. The Government also reaffirms its stance as a facilitator in the
third amendment by specifically making a resolution plan binding on the Central Government,
State Governments or a local authority to whom debt in respect of payment of dues is owed.
Group Insolvency
Insolvency and Bankruptcy Code provides detailed provisions to deal with the insolvency of a
corporate debtor on standalone basis, it does not envisage a framework to either
synchronise insolvency proceedings of different corporate debtors in a group or resolve
their insolvencies together. Consequently, the insolvency of different corporate debtors
belonging to the same group is dealt with through separate insolvency proceedings for each
corporate debtor.
However, in the insolvency resolution of some corporate debtors, including Videocon, Era
infrastructure, Lanco, Educomp, Amtek, Adel, Jaypee and Aircel, special issues arose from their
interconnections with other group companies. In some of these cases, the Adjudicating
Authority under the Code as well as the Supreme Court, in some cases, have passed orders to
partially ameliorate some such issues.
In the case of Venugopal Dhoot v. State Bank of India & Ors., (CA- 1022(PB)/2018- decision dated
24.10.2018) multiple companies of the Videocon group were being put through insolvency
resolution processes. In this case, parties sought that all matters pertaining to the insolvency
resolution of different Videocon companies be dealt with by the same Adjudicating Authority
and that there be consolidation of separate proceedings of multiple Videocon companies to treat
“the corporate insolvency resolution process as one in respect of all of these companies”.
The Principal Bench of the National Company Law Tribunal (“NCLT”) ordered that all the
matters regarding the insolvency resolution processes of these different companies be dealt
with by the same bench of the NCLT for the purpose of “avoiding conflicting orders and
facilitating the hearing” of these matters.
In the case of Chitra Sharma v. Union of India, W.P. (Civil) No(s).744/2017- decision dated
11.09.2017 where insolvency proceedings had been initiated against Jaypee Infratech Ltd., but
homebuyers had entered into contracts with both Jaypee Infratech Ltd. and its parent
company Jai Prakash Associates Ltd., the Supreme Court ordered that the parent company
which was not subject to the insolvency proceedings at that time, deposit a sum of INR two
thousand crores before the court.
In the case of Bikram Chatterji v. Union of India, (W.P. (Civil) No(s).940/2017- decisions dated
17.05.2018 and 01.08.2018 ) homebuyers in projects developed by different companies of the
Amrapali group filed a Writ Petition before the Supreme Court in order to protect their
interests in the wake of the insolvency of different Amrapali group companies. The Supreme
Court in these proceedings dealt with the group as a whole. Given the nature of the
transactions between the group companies, the Court also ordered that the properties of
all forty group companies in the Amrapali group be attached and the bank accounts of all
companies and their directors be frozen.

Case Analysis: Group Insolvency of Videocon Industries Ltd. & Ors.
An Application was filed before National Company Law Tribunal(NCLT) on 30.10.2018 by State
Bank of India (SBI) to seek an order for the ‘Consolidation’ of the Corporate Insolvency
Resolution Process (“CIRP”) of (1) Videocon Industries Ltd. (VIL), (2) Videocon

(g) That a common COC may be constituted for all the Corporate Debtors so that the

to diminish the scope of any conflicting decision;
(h) That September 25, 2018 shall be considered as the common insolvency
commencement date for all the corporate debtors and therefore, the maximum period
during which CIRP has to be completed in accordance with section 12 of the Code shall

(i) That a comprehensive Resolution Plan dealing with all or a collection of the Corporate
Debtors based on relevant factors including without limitation commonality of
business may be formulated and approved by the COC and put up for approval before
this Tribunal for its approval in accordance with the provisions of the Code.”
It is submitted by the Learned Counsel for State Bank of India (SBI) that the business activities
of each of the Corporate Debtors are inextricably interlinked and intertwined. There is
tremendous interdependent amongst each of the Corporate Debtor. It is pleaded that pursuant
to Rupee Term Loan Agreement dated August 8, 2012 (RTL Agreement) a consortium of banks
and financial institutions led by the Applicant had agreed to grant a rupee terms loan to VIL,
KAIL, Electroworld, Value Industries, Evans Fraser, Millennium Appliances, PE Electronics,
Techno Electronics, Trend Electronics, Applicomp, Techno Kart, Sky Appliances and Century
Appliances (RTL Obligors) under an “obligator” structure. The Rupee term loans under the RTL
Agreement were to be utilized for the purposes of refinancing of existing Rupee debt of the RTL
obligators, funding the capital expenditure in relation to the Ravva field and the capital
expenditure in relation to the consumer electronics and home appliances business of the RTL
Obligators and such other end users as permitted by the facility agreement under the RTL
agreement.
One of the constituent of the RTL is CE India. CE India, pursuant to indenture of mortgage dated
March 20, 2013, created charge by way of mortgage over, inter alia, the Videocon brand,
goodwill, trademarks and patents to secure the Rupee Term Loan facility granted to the RTL
obligors pursuant to the RTL Agreement.
Case Studies
36 APRIL 2020 | CASE STUDIES
Another constituent of the agreement was Videocon Telecommunications Ltd. (VTL), which had
availed of Rupee Term Loan facility from certain lenders including SBI pursuant to the terms
and conditions of Rupee Facility Agreement dated May 31, 2010, as amended by the Agreement
of Modification to the Rupee Facility Agreement dated August, 30, 2010 (collectively the “VTL
Agreement”).
Some of the Corporate Debtors have also availed working capital facilities, most of which have
been guaranteed by VIL.
Due to 'defaults' in the accounts of the Corporate Debtor, a “Joint Lenders’ Forum” (JLF) of the
lenders of the RTL obligors and the lenders of VTL was constituted in accordance with RBI
guidelines. Pursuant to the decision taken as part of the collective-action-plan by the combined
JLF in its meeting held on June 04th 2016, it was decided to release proceeds received by VTL
upon sale of Unified Access Services Licenses from the relevant escrow account and utilize the
amount for servicing existing debt of VTL and the RTL obligors.
The lenders/banks have also agreed that security available to the lenders under the RTL
Agreement will be shared on pari-passu basis with the lenders under the VTL agreement and
further, the security available to the lenders under the VTL Agreement will be shared on paripassu basis
with lenders under the RTL Agreement.
VTL agreed by way of a Confirmation Agreement dated June 20, 2016 that it shall be deemed to
be “Co-obligor” under the RTL Agreement. The RTL obligors agreed that each of the RTL obligors
shall be deemed to be a “Co-obligor” under the VTL Agreement.
It is further noticed that on account of 'inter-linkage' and 'interdependence' in business and
operations of the Corporate Debtors, they used to prepare ‘consolidated financial statements’ so
as to give the overall financial position of the RTL obligors as a whole for the benefit of the
various stake holders.
The lenders and other stake-holders of RTL obligors dealt with the RTL obligors a ‘singleeconomic-unit’
as per the ‘consolidated financial statements’.
Therefore, SBI submitted this Application before NCLT for substantive consolidation of CIRP of
the corporate debtors. Another Application MA 1416/2018 is filed by the promoter of the
Videocon group of companies Mr. Venugopal Dhoot seeking the similar relief of ‘Consolidation’
of CIRP i.e. commencement of Insolvency Process under Insolvency Code of all the group
companies of Videocon which are undergoing insolvency..Mr. Venugopal Dhoot is a guarantor,
shareholder and also the ex-managing Director/Chairman of the Videocon Group of Companies.
The relief sought in this application is similar as was in the previous application MA 1306/2018
i.e. for the ‘substantive consolidation’ of the CIRP of the above stated 15 Corporate Debtors for
a successful resolution and restructuring of Videocon Group of Companies. The facts of this case
and arguments supporting the consolidation of CIRP of the Corporate Debtor in this application
are no different than as stated in MA 1306/2018. Hence both these applications can be disposed
of cumulatively.
Adjudication Authority Order
In the case of State Bank of India & Anr. vs. Videocon Industries Ltd. & Ors., (M.A 1306/ 2018 & Ors.
in CP No. 02/2018 & Ors- decision dated 08.08.2019, Para 82 ) the Adjudicating Authority ordered
that:

s
....................Decisively, the above discussion has deciphered cases of this group into two
categories. Rather it is absolutely necessary to place my view with humility that if at all a
question of ‘Group Insolvency’ is to be answered in such type of group of cases, then in that
situation, a blanket view is not possible to declare that the entire Group is fit to be
CONSOLIDATED simply being connected or controlled by common management. Although,
these two factors are necessary for determination of ‘consolidation’, but not the only basis.
Over and above, each unit or subsidiary is to be examined on its merits, that whether all the
parameters are being satisfied or not. These parameters in fact are the ‘factors’ to
distinguish the units in two categories, precisely as under:-
a. A category/ classification of those cases can be made where the business operations are
so dove-tailed that their management, deployment of staff, production of goods,
distribution system, arrangement of funds, loan facilities etc. are so intricately interlinked
that segregation may result in an unviable solution. Over and above, most important is that
if segregated, the possibility of restructuring or the option of maximisation of value of
assets become so bleak which shall overweigh the consolidation.
b. The other category/ classification can be of such group cases where the accounts are
interlinked and due to the existence of debt agreement, the liabilities have become common
but assets are identifiable. Hence, on segregation the independent structure of each unit
shall survive which shall also result into viable profitable restructuring proposals.
Therefore, in this category of cases, although for the limited purpose of signing of certain
documents through which loan facilities might have been commonly availed but that can
be segregated so that the assets and liabilities are identifiable separately thus facilitating
a good investor...................
Further, the National Company Law Tribunal (NCLT) in February 2020 has ordered the
inclusion of VIL's overseas oil and gas companies are VOVL Ltd, Videocon
Hydrocarbon Holdings Ltd. (VHHL), Videocon Energy Brasil Ltd (VEBL), Videocon Indonesia
Nunukan Inc. (VINI) in the ongoing insolvency process being conducted in the country. The
Tribunal also directed the resolution professional (RP) to include the assets, liabilities, claims of
the above mentioned overseas assets/companies in the information memorandum of Videocon
Industries.
Conclusion
Working Group on Group Insolvency in its Report submitted to the Insolvency and Bankruptcy
Board of India on 23rd September, 2019 recommended that a legislative framework on
substantive consolidation need not be introduced in the first phase of implementing a
framework dealing with the insolvency of group companies and the IBBI and the Government
could consider the need for substantive consolidation mechanisms in India and devise the
necessary framework for the same at a later date.

SECURITIES AND EXCHANGE BOARD OF INDIA AND SECURITIES
APPELLATE TRIBUNAL ORDERS ON KARVY STOCK BROKING
LIMITED–BRIEF FACTS SO FAR*
Background
Karvy Stock Broking Limited (KSBL) is incorporated as provider of financial services company
in India. It provides the services related to stock broking, depository participant, distribution of
financial products (including mutual funds, bonds and fixed deposits), commodities broking,
personal finance advisory services, wealth management and alike. Its headquarter is situated in
Hyderabad.
During 2019, many investors complained to SEBI about discrepancies in their Demat accounts
held by KSBL. Scores of investors complained that the firm had not provided their stipulated
payouts.
In India, settlement happens on T+2 basis, where ‘T’ is the day of trading. The abbreviations T+2
basis means that the final settlement of transactions done on T, i.e., trade day by exchange of
monies and securities between the buyers and sellers respectively takes place on second
business day (excluding Saturdays, Sundays, Bank and Exchange trading holidays) after the
trade day. For instance, if a person buys (or sells) a security with a T+2 settlement basis on
Monday, assuming there are no holidays during the week, the settlement date will be on
Wednesday. The 'T' or trading date is counted as a separate day. Therefore, a person should get
the money in his account on the third day of transaction but some clients alleged that they didn’t
receive the payments after more than a week of executing the trades.
Following this, the National Stock Exchange of India Limited (NSE) initiated a limited period
probe on August 19, 2019 covering a period from January 1, 2019 onwards and provided its
preliminary report on the non-compliances observed with respect to the pledging/misuse of
client securities by KSBL to the SEBI.
On the basis of this report, SEBI banned KSBL from new client operations in the stock market.
Further, the National Stock Exchange (NSE) also initiated the forensic audit of KSBL in order to
examine in detail the cases of misuse of client funds and securities.
Facts of the Case
1) KSBL has opened a DP account no. 11458979, named KARVY STOCK BROKING LTD
(BSE) in December 2000 and categorised it as Beneficiary Client. It didn’t report this
DP account in the filings made by it in Stock-Exchange from January, 2019 to August,
2019;

s
2) It was found that the KSBL has mishandled its client’s securities by misusing the Power
of Attorney (PoA) given to it by its clients. It has transferred securities from client’s
demat accounts to the demat accounts controlled by it;
3) KSBL credited the funds raised by pledging of client securities to six of its own bank
accounts (“Stock Broker-own Account”) instead of the “Stock Broker-Client Account”
and further has not reported these six own bank accounts (“Stock Broker-own
Account”) to Exchange which is required to be reported under the provisions of
enhanced supervision, as stipulated under SEBI Circular No. SEBI/HO/MIRSD/
MIRSD2/CIR/P/2016/95 dated September 26, 2016;
4) The securities lying in the aforesaid Demat account of KSBL actually belong to the
clients who are the legitimate owners of those pledged securities. Therefore, KSBL did
not have any legal right to create a pledge on these securities and generate funds. If at
all the client securities were pledged, it should be only for meeting the obligation of
the respective clients.
5) Apparently as per report of NSE, KSBL has transferred a net amount of approx. Rs.
1,096 crores of client’s money to its group company i.e. Karvy Realty Private Limited
over a period of three years. Approximately, around 1 Lakh clients are estimated to be
impacted by this scam.
Since last one year, SEBI has brought in a number of new regulations to improve the health of
the stock broking industry. SEBI has strictly defined the do's and don'ts of handling of Clients’
Securities by Trading Members (TM)/Clearing Members (CM). All TM/CM are required to
transfer the clients securities received in pay-out to client’s demat account within one working
day. In case the client does not pay for such securities received in pay-out, then the TM/CM shall
be entitled to retain those securities up to five trading days after pay-out. Further, where the
client fails to meet its funds pay-in obligation within five trading days from pay-out day, the
TM/CM shall liquidate the securities in the market to recover its dues. Under no circumstances,
shall the securities of the clients received in pay-out be retained by the TM/CM beyond five
trading days and be used for any other purpose. Client’s securities lying with the TM/CM in
“client collateral account”, “Client Margin Trading Securities account” and “client unpaid
securities account” cannot be pledged to the Banks/NBFCs for raising funds even with
authorization by client as the same would amount to fund based activity by TM/CM which is in
contravention of Rule 8(1)(f) & 8(3)(f) of Securities Contracts (Regulation) Rules, 1957 with
effect from September 01, 2019.
Further, the client’s securities already pledged in terms of clause 2.5 of SEBI Circular
SEBI/HO/MIRSD/MIRSD2/CIR/P/2016/95 dated September 26, 2016 and clause 2 (c) of SEBI
circular CIR/HO/MIRSD/MIRSD2/CIR/P/2017/64 dated June 22, 2017 shall by August 31, 2019
either be unpledged and return to the clients upon fulfilment of pay-in obligation or disposed
off after giving notice of 5 days to the client.
KSBL had, however, failed to comply with SEBI’s guidelines and continued the misuse of client’s
securities.
SEBI Order1
SEBI after examining all the facts and circumstances found gross violations of its rules and
regulations on part of KSBL and on 22nd November, 2019, issued following directions by way of
1. SEBI Order dated 22nd November, 2019
Case Studies
40 APRIL 2020 | CASE STUDIES
ex-parte order under Sections 11(1), 11(4) and 11B read with Section 19 of the SEBI Act, 1992
and Regulation 35 of SEBI (Intermediaries) Regulations, 2008:
i) KSBL is prohibited from taking new clients in respect of its stock broking activities;
ii) The Depositories i.e. NSDL and CDSL, in order to prevent further misuse of clients’
securities by KSBL, are hereby directed not to act upon any instruction given by KSBL
in pursuance of power of attorney given to KSBL by its clients, with immediate effect;
iii) The Depositories shall monitor the movement of securities into and from the DP
account of clients of KSBL as DP to ensure that clients operations are not affected;
iv) The Depositories shall not allow transfer of securities from DP account no. 11458979,
named KARVY STOCK BROKING LTD (BSE) with immediate effect. The transfer of
securities from this account shall be permitted only to the respective beneficial owner
who has paid in full against these securities, under supervision of NSE; and
v) The Depositories and Stock Exchanges shall initiate appropriate disciplinary regulatory
proceedings against the Noticee (KSBL) for misuse of clients’ funds and securities as
per their respective bye laws, rules and regulations.
Further, NSE via order/circular dated 2nd December, 2019 has suspended KSBL from its
membership due to the alleged non compliance of the regulatory provisions of the Exchange.
Meanwhile, to prevent Karvy’s lenders to claim on the securities, SEBI used a pre-emptive move
and directed the depositories to transfer the securities under supervision of SEBI and NSE from
Karvy Stock Broking Limited’s demat account to the demat account of respective clients who are
the legitimate owners and who have paid in full. This heroic move of SEBI has given relief to
approximately 87% of the investors whose securities were unlawfully pledged by Karvy.
Legal Battle
Appeal filed by KSBL before the Securities Appellate Tribunal (SAT), MUMBAI against
SEBI and NSE
KSBL being aggrieved by the ex-parte ad-interim order given by SEBI has filed an appeal before
SAT asking for clarification from Whole Time Member (WTM) of SEBI regarding direction issued
by SEBI in its point no (ii) of the ex-parte order dated 22nd November, 2019, which restrains the
depositories to act upon any instruction given by KSBL in pursuance of power of attorney given
to it by its clients. According to KSBL, they are facing difficulties in settling of the trades of their
clients with the clearing house. Considering the aforesaid facts, the necessary clarifications were
sought from the SEBI.
In an another appeal filed by KSBL against NSE seeking to quash the impugned order/circular
dated 2nd December, 2019 related to suspension of its membership from NSE due to the alleged
non-compliance of the regulatory provisions of the Exchange with effect from 2nd December,
2019.
After hearing both the sides in case of first appeal against SEBI, SAT on 2nd December, 2019 has
given direction to the WTM to consider the request of the KSBL and provide clarification on
direction no. (ii) of the ex-parte SEBI order dated 22nd November, 2019.
CASE STUDIES | APRIL 2020 41
Case Studie
s
For the second appeal against NSE, after hearing the both sides, the tribunal on 3rd December,
2019 said that KSBL would be at liberty to file an appeal under the NSE Rules. In case, if such an
appeal is filed, appellant (KSBL) shall be heard as expeditiously as possible.
However in February, 2020 KSBL has withdrawn both these appeals from the SAT against
NSE and SEBI.
Appeal filed by Lenders of KSBL (HDFC Bank, ICICI Bank, Bajaj Finance, IndusInd Bank)
before the Securities Appellate Tribunal (SAT) against SEBI, Karvy Stock Broking Limited,
NSE and NSDL.
Aggrieved by the SEBI order dated 22nd November, 2019 the lenders of KSBL i.e. HDFC Bank,
ICICI Bank, Bajaj Finance Limited, IndusInd Bank filed different appeals before the Securities
Appellate Tribunal (SAT). The lenders sought to quash the above mentioned ex-parte SEBI
order, which prevented them from accessing the pledged securities. They also wanted SAT to
set aside the NSDL’s move of transferring of these securities to client accounts. They asserted
that they have bonafide rights on those securities and it was common industry practice to lend
against pledged shares (LAS) and there was no reason to suspect Karvy’s claim that it owned
those shares.
After hearing all the parties, the Securities Appellate Tribunal (SAT) on 3rd December, 2019 and
4th December, 2019 without going into the merit of the case directed SEBI to consider the
representation(s) of the lenders of KSBL and, after giving an fair opportunity of being heard,
pass an order as per law.
Appeal filed by Axis Bank Limited before the Securities Appellate Tribunal (SAT), against
SEBI, National Stock Exchange of India Limited, Central Depository Services (India)
Limited, National Securities Depository Limited and Karvy Stock Broking Limited.
Meanwhile Axis Bank Limited received communication from National Securities Depository
Limited (NSDL) on 23rdNovember, 2019 which states that NSDL has put the DP account
number19502787 of Karvy in abeyance and hence the Axis Bank is prevented from accessing the
securities pledged with it by Karvy Stock Broking Limited (KSBL).Aggrieved by the aforesaid
communication, the Bank has challenged this order in SAT, stating that it was illegal and without
jurisdiction.
Axis Bank contended that its position viz-a-viz. other lenders who appealed before this Tribunal
earlier is different in the sense while the other lenders/ appellants were directly impacted by
direction no. (iv) of the SEBI ex-parte order dated 22nd November, 2019, it’s illegal extension of
that order by NSDL that has impacted it. This is because vide direction no. (iv) only a particular
account of no. 11458979, named KARVY STOCK BROKING LTD (BSE) of KSBL was frozen; there is
no such direction relating to freezing or restricting in any manner the DP account number19502787
relevant to the lender.
The Axis Bank has claimed that an aggregate amount of about Rs. 81 crores and further interest
etc. are due from KSBL which was given to it in the form of overdraft against shares (“OAS”) from
time to time. It was contended that under the provisions of the Depositories Act, 1996 the
pledgee has rights over the securities pledged and such rights could not be arbitrarily kept in
abeyance or extinguished without following the due process.
Hence, Axis Bank sought the quashing and setting aside of NSDL’s move to keep the pledged
securities in abeyance. It also demanded quashing of directions given by SEBI order dated 22nd
November, 2019 particularly those which were preventing it from exercising its right over
Case Studies

pledged securities. Further it requested SAT to issue a restraining order against NSDL, SEBI, and
CDSL from taking any action against the bank, if it exercises its rights over pledged securities.
After hearing all the parties the Securities Appellate Tribunal on 17th December,2019(later
modified its order on 20th December, 2019) directed SEBI to pass an order by 15th January, 2020
on Axis Bank's plea and pass appropriate directions. Meanwhile the status quo shall be
maintained in respect of the securities in Account No. 19502787 named “Karvy Stock Broking
Limited- Client Account-NSE CM”.
Securities and Exchange Board of India in respect of representation made pursuant to
order of Hon’ble SAT, by Axis Bank Limited
In view of the aforesaid order passed by the Hon’ble SAT, SEBI provided an opportunity of being
heard to the Axis Bank Limited along with other concerned entities like National Stock Exchange
of India Limited (NSE), Karvy Stock Broking Ltd. (KSBL), National Securities Depository Limited
(NSDL) and Central Depositories Services Limited (CDSL).
As per the data provided by NSE, securities pledged by KSBL in favour of Axis Bank belonged to
its fully paid as well as partly or unpaid clients. The value of securities belonging to fully paid
client is Rs 171.74 crore and the value of securities of other than fully paid clients is Rs 13.69
crore.
The Axis Bank contended that the pledge created by KSBL on the securities was in accordance
with the provisions of SEBI circular dated 26th September, 2016 and was a valid pledge. It has
further been argued that such a validly created pledge has not been rendered invalid by SEBI
circular dated 20th June, 2019 which merely casts obligation on the stock brokers to unpledge
all the securities belonging to their client and does not declare pledges so created as invalid.
Further, Axis Bank contended that prior to the enforcement of SEBI circular dated 20th June,
2019, in terms of SEBI circular dated 26th September, 2016, with regard to pledging of securities
belonging to partly paid/unpaid clients, stock broker was entitled to have a lien on client’s
securities only to the extent of indebtedness of the client and the stock broker could pledge
securities of indebted clients with the “explicit authorization” of the client. Further, they have
urged that the PoA given by the client was sufficient authorization to create such a pledge.
Accordingly, SEBI after assessing all the facts and circumstances held that regarding pledging of
securities of fully paid clients, a stock broker has no authority to pledge the securities of its fully
paid clients. If a stock broker pledges securities of its fully paid clients, it amounts to
misappropriation of clients’ securities by the stock broker. Even if securities belong to fully paid
clients are pledged by the stock broker, such pledge does not pass any title to the pledgee, as the
stock broker in such case himself/itself does not possess any title/right over such securities.
Thus, pledge of securities, belonging to fully paid client, is not treated as valid pledge in law. `
Further, SEBI disagreed with such interpretation given to the scope of PoA. The SEBI circular
dated 23rd April, 2010, makes it clear that the PoA given by the client to the broker can be used
for the purpose of pledging in favour of the stock broker, “only” for the purposes of meeting the
margin requirements. The authorization claimed under said PoA by the Axis Bank is not the
“explicit authorization” of the client, as referred to under SEBI circular dated 26th September,
2016.

s
The bank in its representation to SEBI also prayed that in respect of partly or unpaid clients,
KSBL be directed to issue five days’ notice to the clients or the bank be allowed to issue five
days’ notice to clients to enable the clients redeem the pledged shares by making payment of the
corresponding outstanding indebtedness, failing which the lender be permitted to invoke the
pledge on shares.
SEBI rejected Axis Bank’s plea. It ascertain that if the bank is able to show proof of authorisation
in respect of securities having value of Rs. 13.69 crore belong to unpaid clients, such securities
can be released to it after following the procedure under supervision of NSE.
Later, SEBI also rejected the relief sought by the other four lenders i.e. (Bajaj Finance Limited,
HDFC Bank Limited, ICICI Bank Limited, IndusInd Bank Limited) urging it as not tenable.
After rejection of the Axis bank’s plea by SEBI, it has filed an appeal before SAT against the SEBI
order dated 14th January, 2020. The SAT granted interim relief to Axis Bank by directing status
quo to be maintained on the SEBI order till further hearing on the matter.
Move by Ministry of Corporate Affairs
Meanwhile viewing such developments in this case, Ministry of Corporate Affairs in the month
of January, 2020, ordered a probe into the affairs of the KSBL under Section 206 of the Companies
Act, 2013- Power to Call for Information, Inspect Books and Conduct Inquiries. MCA directed
Registrar of Companies (RoC), Hyderabad to conduct such inquiry. MCA has also asked RoC to
examine if KSBL, its promoters and officials have violated the provisions of the Companies Act,
2013 and committed non-compoundable offences which are punishable by imprisonment. RoC
had to look into the instances of misrepresentation of facts or misstatements in filing of balance
sheets and other necessary documents. It has also been asked to look into the relationship
between various Karvy groups and related party transactions. MCA also probed regarding any
misuse or diversion of funds and in what manner the money that KSBL borrowed from banks
and financial institutions was utilised.
Based on the Registrar of Companies (RoC) inquiry report submitted in February, 2020, pointing
towards a potential fraud. The Central Government in exercise of powers conferred under
Section 212(1) (a) & (C) of the Companies Act, 2013 has formed an opinion that the affairs of the
KSBL need to be investigated to examine the serious nature of fraud committed as large public
interest is involved.
The knot has further tightened around Karvy Stock Broking Ltd with the Ministry of Corporate
Affairs (MCA) ordering a Serious Fraud Investigation Office (SFIO) probe into the alleged
financial irregularities of the company. MCA directed the SFIO officials to investigate into the
affairs of Karvy and its group companies.
KSBL sought interim relief from High Court, Telangana, so as to prevent MCA officials from
taking any ‘coercive steps including investigation under Section 212 of the Companies Act 2013.
It further argued that the RoC’s investigation under Section 206 to 208 of Companies Act, 2013
were ongoing and not final. Besides, the final decision of SEBI is also pending. Karvy, in its
affidavit, contended that the Ministry of Corporate Affairs has taken the decision without
following due process of law, proper enquiry and giving an opportunity to be heard, passed the
order in violation of principles of natural justice.
Case Studies
44 APRIL 2020 | CASE STUDIES
But Telangana High Court in the month of March, 2020 dismissed its petition, urging that the
Central government has already taken a decision on the issue and granted liberty to the
company to file another petition challenging the order.
On 25th February, 2020, SEBI to further tightened the norm of capital market has issued a
circular related to Margin obligations to be given by way of Pledge/ Re-pledge in the Depository
System in order to devise a framework that mitigates the risk of misappropriation or misuse of
client’s securities available with the Trading Members (TM) /Clearing Members (CM) /
Depository Participants (DP) so that to prevent incidents such as Karvy Broking Services, which
had allegedly misused clients’ securities.
Aforementioned SEBI circular states that with effect from 01st June, 2020, TM / CM shall, inter
alia, accept collateral from clients in the form of securities, only by way of ‘margin pledge’,
created in the Depository system in accordance with Section 12 of the Depositories Act, 1996
read with Regulation 79 of the SEBI (Depositories and Participants) Regulations, 2018 and the
relevant Bye Laws of the Depositories. Any procedure followed other than as specified under
the aforesaid provisions of law for creating pledge of the dematerialised securities is prohibited.
It is clarified that an off-market transfer of securities leads to change in ownership and shall not
be treated as pledge. Transfer of securities to the demat account of the TM / CM for margin
purposes (i.e. title transfer collateral arrangements) shall be prohibited. In case, a client has
given a power of attorney in favour of a TM / CM, such holding of power of attorney shall not be
considered as equivalent to the collection of margin by the TM / CM in respect of securities held
in the demat account of the client.
The TM / CM shall be required to close all existing demat accounts tagged as ‘Client Margin/
Collateral’ by June 30, 2020. The TM / CM shall be required to transfer all client’s securities lying
in such accounts to the respective clients’ demat accounts. Thereafter, TM / CM are prohibited
from holding any client securities in any beneficial owner accounts of TM/CM, other than
specifically tagged accounts as indicated above, and in pool account(s), unpaid securities
account, as provided in SEBI Circular CIR/HO/MIRSD/DOP/CIR/P/2019/75 dated 20th June,
2019.
Although, this move against Karvy is a part of a long-drawn effort of SEBI to tighten the scrutiny
over brokers’ misuse of client money and putting through unauthorized trades yet this Karvy
scam raised many questions and concerns. It is apparent that it is not the end but a mere
beginning. Since such an event is possible, it must be happening at a smaller scale elsewhere too.
Certainly, from anecdotal evidence, it would appear that ‘temporary’ use of clients’ holdings
happens at a certain scale. Having use of other’s money is a great temptation. SEBI must ensure
stringent regime and take effective steps to prevent such scams in future.

*Karvy Stock Broking Limited (KSBL) provided a range of financial services, including stock broking,
depository participant services, distribution of financial products, commodities broking, personal finance
advisory services, wealth management, and more.*
2. **What was the main issue that led to complaints and investigations against KSBL in 2019?**
*In 2019, many investors complained about discrepancies in their Demat accounts held by KSBL. The

not have been based on a unique process.
**Q23:** What action did the defendants take after their resignation from the plaintiffs' company?
**A23:** After resigning from the plaintiffs' company, the defendants planned to launch a prenatal
supplement named 'NUTRIEPIC,' which the plaintiffs claimed was based on similar ingredients and

'CARE'?

compliance with any future court orders or agreements. It serves as a form of ongoing oversight.
**Q27:** What is the significance of the pending trademark application for 'LAYERCARE' in the case?

**A29:** In this context, a 'springboard advantage' refers to the idea that the defendants gained an
unfair advantage by using confidential information from their previous employment with the plaintiffs
to develop and launch a competing product. However, the court found this claim unsubstantiated.
**Q30:** How did the court describe the plaintiffs' product 'TRIMACARE'?

Healthcare, to protect confidential information. It established a contractual obligation to maintain the
secrecy of sensitive information.

license for 'TRIMACARE'?

**Q33:** How did the court respond to the defendants' claim that there was no misuse of confidential
information?

evidence to support their claim of misuse of confidential information. Therefore, the court did not find
merit in this argument.
**Q34:** What factors did the court consider in assessing whether there was a likelihood of confusion
between the plaintiffs' and defendants' products?
**A34:** The court considered factors such as the generic nature of the term 'CARE,' the dissimilarity in
visual and phonetic aspects of the marks 'LAYERCARE' and 'UTTERCARE,' and the differences in
packaging to evaluate the likelihood of confusion.
**Q35:** Did the court take into account the pending trademark application for 'LAYERCARE' when
making its decision?
**A35:** The court acknowledged the pending trademark application for 'LAYERCARE' but did not rely
on it as a significant basis for its decision regarding the passing-off claim.

'NUTRIEPIC' on a bi-annual basis?

**A37:** In this context, a 'springboard advantage' refers to the potential advantage gained by the
defendants from their previous employment with the plaintiffs, where they may have had access to
confidential information. The court ultimately did not find substantial evidence to support this claim.

Indian women.

personnel.
**Q42:** How did the court view the plaintiffs' claim of having a 'family of marks' with the word 'CARE'?
**A42:** The court viewed the claim of a 'family of marks' with skepticism, noting that the plaintiffs had
launched 'TRIMACARE' and 'LAYERCARE' relatively recently and had not established substantial goodwill
or reputation in these marks.
**Q43:** Could you explain what the plaintiffs' medicine 'LAYERCARE' is and when it was launched?
**A43:** 'LAYERCARE' is a diagnostic medicine launched by the plaintiffs on February 9, 2022, with a
pending trademark application. It appears to be a distinct product from 'TRIMACARE.'
**Q44:** Did the court find any evidence of infringement of the plaintiffs' intellectual property rights in
the trademarks?
**A44:** No, the court did not find evidence of infringement of the plaintiffs' intellectual property
rights, and it specifically mentioned that 'CARE' is a generic word over which exclusivity cannot be
claimed.
**Q45:** What was the basis for the court's decision to vacate the ex-parte ad interim injunction
granted earlier?

trademark infringement, and passing off.
**Q46:** Did the court entirely dismiss the plaintiffs' case, or is it still pending for further examination?
**A46:** The court's decision primarily vacated the ex-parte ad interim injunction. The case itself is still
pending, and the court ordered it to proceed for the completion of pleadings.
**Q47:** What is the significance of the bi-annual disclosure of sales by the defendants?

from the plaintiffs' product 'TRIMACARE.'
